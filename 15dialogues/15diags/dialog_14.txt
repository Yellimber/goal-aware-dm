"Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? "," Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . "," I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? "," I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . "," You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? "," Once in a while . "," It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . "," I hope I can practice self-control again . "
